# 🦾 Darth Vader — The Force in Your VS Code

Bring balance (and a bit of fun) to your coding galaxy with **Darth Vader** — a fully animated Darth Vader cheering you on while you code, right inside Visual Studio Code’s panel view. ⚡

---

## ✨ Features

- 🖤 **Animated Darth Vader** — rendered with pure HTML + CSS.
- 💬 **Cheering Speech Bubbles** — random motivational or humorous Vader quotes appear as you code.
- ⚡ **Dynamic Lightsaber** — with glowing animation and swing effects.
- 🎨 **VS Code Theme Integration** — adapts automatically to your current color theme (dark/light).
- 🪄 **Panel View Support** — opens neatly in the **Panel** (like “VS Code Pets”), not as a sidebar. You can also drag the panel to left side under Explorer for better visibility.
